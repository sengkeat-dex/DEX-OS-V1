```rust
/// Implements Graph for DEX Liquidity Network and Hash Map for Route Caching
/// as specified in DEX-OS-V1.csv for DEX Aggregator
/// 
/// This implements the Priority 1 features from DEX-OS-V1.csv:
/// "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Graph,DEX Liquidity Network,High"
/// "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Hash Map,Route Caching,High"
impl PathRouter {
    /// Find the best path from source to destination token using Bellman-Ford algorithm
    /// with route caching for improved performance
    pub fn find_best_path(
        &mut self,
        source: &TokenId,
        destination: &TokenId,
        amount: f64,
    ) -> Result<Option<RoutingPath>, PathRoutingError> {
        // Implementation using Graph for DEX Liquidity Network
        // with Hash Map for Route Caching
    }
}
```

### Verification Process

Before committing code that implements algorithms or data structures:

1. **Verify CSV Reference**: Confirm the algorithm/data structure is correctly referenced from [DEX-OS-V1.csv](DEX-OS-V1.csv)
2. **Check Priority Level**: Ensure you're implementing features in the correct priority sequence
3. **Validate Implementation**: Test that your implementation matches the expected behavior of the specified algorithm
4. **Document Usage**: Include the CSV reference in your commit message and documentation

This approach ensures that all implementations follow the architectural decisions made for the DEX-OS project and maintain consistency across all components.

## Priority Level Communication and Dependencies

The DEX-OS project is organized into 5 priority levels, each building upon the previous levels to create a cohesive and functional system. Understanding how these priority levels communicate and depend on each other is crucial for proper implementation sequencing and system architecture.

### Priority Level Overview

1. **Priority 1 (Core Functionality)**: Foundation components that must be implemented first
2. **Priority 2 (Important Features)**: Build upon core functionality with enhanced capabilities
3. **Priority 3 (Useful Enhancements)**: Additional capabilities and improvements
4. **Priority 4 (Advanced Features)**: Sophisticated integrations and advanced functionality
5. **Priority 5 (Infrastructure)**: Supporting components and system-level features

### Communication Patterns Between Priority Levels

#### Vertical Dependencies (Lower to Higher Priority)
- **Priority 1 → Priority 2**: Higher priority features depend on core functionality
  - Example: Order ID lookup (Priority 2) depends on Orderbook storage (Priority 1)
  - Example: StableSwap implementation (Priority 2) builds on AMM foundation (Priority 1)

#### Horizontal Communication (Within Same Priority)
- Features within the same priority level often interact to provide complete functionality
  - Example: Within Priority 1, Orderbook components work together for complete order management
  - Example: Within Priority 2, AMM algorithms complement each other for enhanced trading

#### Cross-Priority Integration
- Higher priority features may integrate with multiple lower priority components
  - Example: DEX Aggregator (Priority 1) integrates with Bridge components (Priority 2)
  - Example: Security features span multiple priority levels (Priority 2 Security Layer, Priority 5 Protection Layer)

### Dependency Management Guidelines

#### Implementation Sequence
1. **Complete Priority 1 before starting Priority 2**: All core components must be fully functional
2. **Validate dependencies before implementation**: Ensure required components exist and function
3. **Document cross-priority integrations**: Clearly identify interactions between priority levels
4. **Test integration points**: Verify that components from different priorities work together

#### Interface Design Between Priorities
- **Stable APIs**: Priority 1 components should provide stable interfaces for higher priorities
- **Clear contracts**: Define clear data structures and function signatures for cross-priority communication
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain compatibility when enhancing lower priority components
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error propagation across priority boundaries

### Data Flow Between Priority Levels

#### Upward Data Flow (Lower to Higher Priority)
- Lower priority components provide data and services to higher priority features
- Example: Orderbook (Priority 1) provides order data to analytics (Priority 4)

#### Downward Control Flow (Higher to Lower Priority)
- Higher priority components may control or configure lower priority features
- Example: Governance (Priority 4) may configure security settings (Priority 2, 5)

#### Lateral Data Exchange (Same Priority)
- Components within the same priority often exchange data directly
- Example: AMM components (Priority 1, 2) exchange liquidity data

### Communication Protocols

#### Internal Component Communication
- **Direct function calls**: For tightly coupled components within the same crate
- **Message passing**: For loosely coupled components or cross-crate communication
- **Event-driven architecture**: For asynchronous notifications between components
- **Shared data structures**: For efficient data access between related components

#### Cross-Priority Communication Mechanisms
- **API interfaces**: Well-defined interfaces between priority levels
- **Data serialization**: Standardized data formats for cross-priority data exchange
- **Error codes and exceptions**: Consistent error handling across priority boundaries
- **Configuration management**: Centralized configuration for cross-priority settings

### Implementation Best Practices

#### When Working on Priority 1 Features
- Design for extensibility to support higher priority features
- Create clear, well-documented interfaces
- Implement comprehensive testing for core functionality
- Consider performance implications for dependent features

#### When Working on Priority 2-5 Features
- Understand dependencies on lower priority components
- Use established interfaces rather than creating new ones
- Validate that lower priority dependencies are complete and functional
- Document how your feature integrates with lower priority components

#### Cross-Priority Development
- **Reference the correct algorithms**: Use algorithms specified in DEX-OS-V1.csv for each priority level
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the architectural patterns established in lower priority levels
- **Test integrations**: Verify that cross-priority features work together correctly
- **Document dependencies**: Clearly identify which lower priority components your feature depends on

### Priority Integration Examples

#### Example 1: Orderbook Evolution
- **Priority 1**: Basic order storage and matching (BTreeMap, Price-Time Priority)
- **Priority 2**: Enhanced features like order ID lookup (Hash Map) and batch proofs (Merkle Tree)
- **Priority 4**: Advanced features like cancellation mechanisms and settlement contracts
- **Communication**: Each level builds upon and extends the previous functionality

#### Example 2: AMM Development
- **Priority 1**: Core pricing mechanisms (Constant Product, StableSwap Invariant)
- **Priority 2**: Enhanced algorithms (Curve Fitting, Newton-Raphson) and fee management
- **Priority 4**: Liquidity pools and smart contracts for swaps
- **Communication**: Mathematical foundations support higher-level trading features

#### Example 3: Security Implementation
- **Priority 2**: Core security layers (Kyber Encryption, Dilithium Signatures)
- **Priority 5**: Protection layers (Rate Limiting, Input Validation) and Security Layers (1-10)
- **Communication**: Multiple security approaches work together to provide comprehensive protection

### Verification Process for Cross-Priority Features

Before implementing features that span multiple priority levels:

1. **Identify all dependencies**: List all lower priority components your feature depends on
2. **Verify completion status**: Confirm that dependent components are complete and functional
3. **Check interfaces**: Ensure you understand the APIs and data structures of dependent components
4. **Plan integration testing**: Design tests that verify cross-priority functionality
5. **Document communication patterns**: Describe how your feature will interact with other priority levels

This approach ensures that the DEX-OS project maintains a coherent architecture where each priority level properly supports and integrates with others, creating a robust and scalable system.

## Error Handling and Warnings Management

Proper error handling and warnings management are critical for building a robust and maintainable DEX-OS system. This section provides guidelines for handling errors and warnings consistently across all components.
