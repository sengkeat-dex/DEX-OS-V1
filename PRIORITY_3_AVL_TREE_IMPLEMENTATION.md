# Priority 3 Feature Implementation: AVL Tree for Order Book Balancing

## Feature Details
- **Priority**: 3
- **Category**: Core Trading
- **Component**: Orderbook
- **Algorithm/Data Structure**: AVL Tree
- **Feature**: Order Book Balancing
- **Task Priority**: Medium

## Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the successful implementation of the AVL Tree for Order Book Balancing feature as specified in the DEX-OS-V1.csv file.

### Files Modified/Added

1. **New Module**: `dex-core/src/avl_tree.rs`
   - Complete implementation of AVL tree data structure
   - Specialized `AvlPriceLevelTree` for orderbook price levels
   - Comprehensive unit tests

2. **Modified Module**: `dex-core/src/orderbook.rs`
   - Added AVL tree fields for bid/ask price level tracking
   - Enhanced order insertion/removal to maintain AVL trees
   - Added new methods for AVL tree operations

3. **Modified Module**: `dex-core/src/lib.rs`
   - Exported the new AVL tree module

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Self-Balancing AVL Tree**:
   - Automatic rebalancing after insertions and deletions
   - O(log n) time complexity for all operations
   - Left and right rotations for maintaining balance

2. **Price Level Tracking**:
   - Efficient tracking of bid and ask price levels
   - Sorted retrieval of all price levels
   - Fast existence checking for specific price levels

3. **Orderbook Integration**:
   - Transparent integration with existing orderbook functionality
   - Automatic synchronization between BTreeMap and AVL tree storage
   - Enhanced API for price level operations

### Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests that verify:
- Basic AVL tree operations (insertion, deletion, search)
- Price level tree operations
- Integration with orderbook functionality
- Edge cases and error conditions

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating the correctness of the implementation.

### Compliance

This implementation satisfies the Priority 3 feature requirement from DEX-OS-V1.csv:
"Core Trading,Orderbook,Orderbook,AVL Tree,Order Book Balancing,Medium"

The implementation follows all guidelines specified in RULES.md, including:
- Proper error handling using Rust's `Result` and `Error` types
- Memory safety through Rust's ownership system
- Comprehensive documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Future Work

Potential enhancements for future iterations:
- Performance optimization for high-frequency trading scenarios
- Additional algorithms for specific use cases
- Extended testing with property-based tests
- Benchmarking and optimization of critical paths
