3. **Post-Kink Utilization Test**
   - Verify interest rate calculation for utilization rates above the kink
   - Test with utilization rates approaching 100%

4. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Test with negative values (should return errors)
   - Test with zero values
   - Test with extreme values

### Loan Management Tests

1. **Loan Creation Tests**

   - Loan creation with different asset types

2. **Loan Repayment Tests**
   - Partial loan repayment
   - Full loan repayment
   - Overpayment handling
   - Repayment of non-existent loans (should return error)
   - Repayment of already repaid loans

3. **Loan Liquidation Tests**
   - Successful loan liquidation
   - Liquidation of non-existent loans (should return error)
   - Liquidation of already liquidated loans

4. **Loan Retrieval Tests**
   - Retrieve existing loan by ID
   - Retrieve non-existent loan (should return None)
   - Retrieve loans for specific borrower

### Accounting System Tests

1. **Interest Calculation Tests**
   - Calculate interest for active loans
   - Calculate interest for repaid loans (should be zero)
   - Calculate interest for liquidated loans (should be zero)
   - Calculate interest for loans with different time periods

2. **Liquidity Management Tests**
   - Supply assets to the protocol
   - Withdraw assets from the protocol
   - Attempt to withdraw more than available (should return error)
   - Check available liquidity calculations

3. **Rate Calculation Tests**
   - Calculate borrow rates for different assets
   - Calculate supply rates for different assets
   - Verify relationship between borrow and supply rates

## Integration Testing

### Module Integration Tests

1. **Interest Rate Model Integration**
   - Integration between interest rate model and loan accounting system
   - Verify that loan interest rates are correctly calculated from model
   - Test rate updates when protocol conditions change

2. **Loan Lifecycle Integration**
   - Complete loan lifecycle from creation to repayment
   - Complete loan lifecycle from creation to liquidation
   - Verify accounting updates throughout loan lifecycle

3. **Asset Management Integration**
   - Test with different asset types
   - Verify proper handling of asset supply and withdrawal
   - Test cross-asset interactions

## Performance Testing

### Stress Tests

1. **High Volume Loan Creation**
   - Create large numbers of loans simultaneously
   - Measure performance impact
   - Verify system stability under load

2. **Interest Calculation Performance**
   - Calculate interest for large numbers of loans
   - Measure calculation time
   - Verify accuracy under stress

3. **Accounting System Performance**
   - Test with large numbers of assets
   - Measure liquidity calculation performance
   - Verify rate calculation performance

## Security Testing

### Input Validation Tests

1. **Invalid Input Tests**
   - Test with negative amounts
   - Test with zero amounts
   - Test with extremely large amounts
   - Test with invalid asset types

2. **Boundary Condition Tests**
   - Test at utilization rate boundaries
   - Test at time calculation boundaries
   - Test at interest rate calculation boundaries

### Error Handling Tests

1. **Error Propagation Tests**
   - Verify that errors are properly propagated
   - Test error handling in all functions
   - Verify that error messages are descriptive

2. **Recovery Tests**
   - Test system recovery from errors
   - Verify that system state remains consistent after errors
   - Test retry mechanisms

## Property-Based Testing

### Mathematical Properties

1. **Interest Rate Properties**
   - Verify that borrow rates are always positive
   - Verify that supply rates are always less than or equal to borrow rates
   - Verify that rates increase with utilization

2. **Accounting Invariants**
   - Verify that total supply equals total borrows plus available liquidity
   - Verify that loan amounts owed are always greater than or equal to principal
   - Verify that reserve calculations are correct
