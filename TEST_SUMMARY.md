# AVL Tree Implementation for Order Book Balancing - Test Summary

## Feature Implemented
- **Priority**: 3
- **Category**: Core Trading
- **Component**: Orderbook
- **Algorithm/Data Structure**: AVL Tree
- **Feature**: Order Book Balancing
- **Task Priority**: Medium

## Implementation Details

### 1. AVL Tree Module (`dex-core/src/avl_tree.rs`)

The AVL tree implementation provides a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1 for each node. This ensures O(log n) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches.

#### Key Components:
1. **AvlNode<T>**: Represents a node in the AVL tree with:
   - Value storage
   - Height tracking
   - Left and right child pointers
   - Balance factor calculation
   - Rotation operations (left and right)

2. **AvlTree<T>**: The main AVL tree structure with:
   - Root node management
   - Insertion with automatic balancing
   - Deletion with automatic balancing
   - Search operations
   - In-order traversal

3. **AvlPriceLevelTree**: A specialized AVL tree for price levels in the orderbook:
   - Optimized for u64 price values
   - Methods for inserting/removing price levels
   - Methods for checking price level existence
   - Methods for retrieving all price levels in sorted order

### 2. Orderbook Integration (`dex-core/src/orderbook.rs`)

The AVL tree has been integrated into the existing orderbook implementation to provide balanced price level storage:

#### New Fields:
- `bid_price_levels`: AVL tree tracking bid price levels
- `ask_price_levels`: AVL tree tracking ask price levels

#### Enhanced Methods:
- `add_bid()`: Now inserts price levels into the AVL tree
- `add_ask()`: Now inserts price levels into the AVL tree
- `remove_bid()`: Now removes empty price levels from the AVL tree
- `remove_ask()`: Now removes empty price levels from the AVL tree

#### New Methods:
- `get_all_bid_price_levels()`: Returns all bid price levels in sorted order
- `get_all_ask_price_levels()`: Returns all ask price levels in sorted order
- `contains_bid_price_level()`: Checks if a bid price level exists
- `contains_ask_price_level()`: Checks if an ask price level exists

### 3. Module Export (`dex-core/src/lib.rs`)

The new AVL tree module has been exported to make it available to other parts of the system.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests that verify:

1. **Basic AVL Tree Operations**:
   - Tree creation
   - Node insertion
   - Node removal
   - Value search
   - Tree balancing

2. **AVL Price Level Tree Operations**:
   - Price level insertion
   - Price level removal
   - Price level existence checking
   - Retrieval of all price levels in sorted order

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty tree operations
   - Single node operations
   - Multiple node operations
   - Sequential insertions that test balancing

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully, demonstrating that:
- The AVL tree correctly maintains balance after insertions and deletions
- Price levels are properly tracked and sorted
- Integration with the orderbook works as expected

## Benefits of AVL Tree Implementation

1. **Performance**: O(log n) time complexity for all operations
2. **Balanced Structure**: Automatic rebalancing ensures optimal tree height
3. **Order Preservation**: In-order traversal provides sorted access to price levels
4. **Scalability**: Efficient handling of large numbers of price levels
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing orderbook functionality
