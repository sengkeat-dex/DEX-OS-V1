# Lending Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the lending features from DEX-OS-V1.csv:

1. `2,Core Trading,Lending,Lending,Interest Rate Model,Compound-style Algorithm,High`
2. `2,Core Trading,Lending,Lending,Accounting System,Loan Tracking,High`

## Implementation Details

### Compound-Style Interest Rate Model

The implementation follows the Compound Finance v2 interest rate model, which uses a dual-slope model:

- **Base Rate**: The minimum interest rate when utilization is 0%
- **Multiplier**: The slope of the interest rate curve up to the kink point
- **Kink Utilization**: The utilization rate where the slope changes
- **Kink Multiplier**: The slope of the interest rate curve after the kink point

The formula is:
- If utilization ≤ kink utilization: `rate = base_rate + utilization * multiplier`
- If utilization > kink utilization: `rate = base_rate + kink_utilization * multiplier + (utilization - kink_utilization) * kink_multiplier`

### Loan Accounting System

The accounting system provides comprehensive loan tracking with the following features:

- **Loan Creation**: Create loans with borrower information, asset details, collateral, and terms
- **Interest Calculation**: Calculate accrued interest based on loan terms and time
- **Loan Repayment**: Process partial or full loan repayments
- **Loan Liquidation**: Handle undercollateralized loans
- **Utilization Tracking**: Monitor protocol utilization rates for interest rate calculations
- **Liquidity Management**: Track available liquidity for borrowing

## Key Components

### Data Structures

1. **AssetType**: Enum representing different asset types (Token, Stablecoin, NFT)
2. **Loan**: Structure representing a loan position with all relevant details
3. **LoanStatus**: Enum representing loan statuses (Active, Repaid, Liquidated, Defaulted)
4. **CompoundInterestRateModel**: Structure implementing the Compound-style interest rate model
5. **LoanAccountingSystem**: Main system for managing loans and accounting

### Functions

1. **Interest Rate Calculations**:
   - `calculate_borrow_rate`: Calculate borrow interest rate based on utilization
   - `calculate_supply_rate`: Calculate supply interest rate based on borrow rate and utilization

2. **Loan Management**:
   - `create_loan`: Create a new loan position
   - `repay_loan`: Process loan repayments
   - `liquidate_loan`: Liquidate undercollateralized loans
   - `get_loan`: Retrieve loan information
   - `get_loans_for_borrower`: Retrieve all loans for a specific borrower

3. **Accounting Functions**:
   - `calculate_interest`: Calculate accrued interest for a loan
   - `accrue_interest`: Update loan with accrued interest
   - `get_available_liquidity`: Get available liquidity for an asset
   - `get_utilization_rate`: Get utilization rate for an asset
   - `get_borrow_rate`: Get borrow rate for an asset
   - `get_supply_rate`: Get supply rate for an asset
