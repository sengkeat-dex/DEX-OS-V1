  - Trading pairs are represented as edges with liquidity weights
  - Supports representation of complex multi-hop trading routes
  - Provides foundation for pathfinding algorithms
  - Implemented efficient graph operations for adding/removing trading edges
  - Supports multiple DEXes with different liquidity profiles

### 2. Hash Map for Route Caching

- **Module**: `dex-core/src/path_routing.rs`
- **Algorithm**: Hash Map
- **Feature Reference**: "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Hash Map,Route Caching,High"

  - Provides efficient O(log n) insertion and O(1) access to the best path
  - Supports selection of optimal routes when multiple paths are available
  - Integrated with existing pathfinding functionality for seamless operation

### 4. Dijkstra's Algorithm (variant) for Route Optimization

- **Module**: `dex-core/src/path_routing.rs`
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Algorithm (variant)

- **Implementation Details**:
  - Implemented variant of Dijkstra's algorithm for route optimization
  - Optimized for finding best multi-hop trading routes
  - Considers liquidity depth and fees in path selection
  - Uses min-heap for efficient node selection
  - Provides optimized pathfinding compared to Bellman-Ford for graphs without negative weights

## Security Considerations

All implementations follow the security guidelines specified in:
- [RULES.md](RULES.md) - General development and security guidelines
- [DEX_SECURITY_TESTING_FEATURES.csv](DEX_SECURITY_TESTING_FEATURES.csv) - Specific security features and testing requirements

Key security aspects implemented:
1. Proper error handling using Rust's `Result` and `Error` types
2. Input validation for all public functions
3. Memory safety through Rust's ownership system
4. Cache invalidation to prevent stale routing data
5. Comprehensive test coverage for both happy path and error cases
6. Documentation of security considerations in code comments

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests that cover:
- Basic functionality verification for graph operations
- Route caching mechanism validation
- Cache invalidation scenarios
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing
- Performance improvements from caching
- Max-Heap based route selection functionality
- Dijkstra's algorithm variant for route optimization
- Integration between different DEX Aggregator components

## Compliance with DEX-OS-V1.csv

These implementations directly correspond to Priority 1 entries in the DEX-OS-V1.csv file:
- "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Graph,DEX Liquidity Network,High"
- "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Hash Map,Route Caching,High"
- "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Max-Heap (implicit),Best Route Selection,High"
- "Core Trading,DEX Aggregator,DEX Aggregator,Dijkstra's Algorithm (variant),Route Optimization,High"

This ensures compliance with the project's architectural decisions and requirements as specified in the development guidelines.

## Performance Improvements

The route caching mechanism provides significant performance improvements:
- Eliminates redundant pathfinding computations for previously calculated routes
- Reduces latency for repeated trading path requests
- Maintains consistency through proper cache invalidation
- Scales efficiently with O(1) average lookup time for cached routes
