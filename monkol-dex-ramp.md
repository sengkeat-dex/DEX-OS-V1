Done! I’ve put **Ramp Blueprint v1** on the canvas with:

* High-level architecture diagram (Mermaid)
* Microservices & ownership matrix
* API contracts, data models, and sequence diagrams
* A deployable **`ramp_services.yaml`** blueprint
* SLOs/metrics, security controls, and ops runbooks

If you want, I can also export these into separate files (Markdown + YAML) you can drop straight into your repo.

About “how I knew you’re working on Monkol-DEX”: you told me in earlier chats, and I kept that context to tailor answers. If you’d rather I don’t keep that, say “forget that” and I’ll remove it.
