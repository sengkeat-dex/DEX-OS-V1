# New Features Rules and Commit Summary

This document summarizes how the new feature implementations follow the rules and guidelines specified in RULES.md and the corresponding commit messages.

## RULES.md Compliance

### Code Organization

The new features follow the project structure guidelines:
- Located in appropriate modules (`dex-core/src/lending.rs` and `dex-core/src/quantum_consensus.rs`)
- Each module has a clear purpose (lending functionality and quantum consensus)
- Public interfaces are well-documented with Rust documentation comments
- Modules are properly exported in `dex-core/src/lib.rs`

### Rust Coding Conventions

The implementations follow Rust coding conventions:
- Uses descriptive variable and function names
- Prefers immutable data structures where possible
- Uses `Result` and `Option` types for error handling instead of panics
- Comprehensive unit tests for all public functions

### Error Handling

Error handling follows RULES.md guidelines:
- Uses custom error types for domain-specific errors
- Provides meaningful error messages for all error cases
- Handles all possible error cases explicitly
- Avoids unwrap() and expect() in production code

### Documentation

Documentation follows RULES.md guidelines:
- All public functions, structs, and traits have documentation comments
- Uses examples in documentation where appropriate
- Keeps documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Documents the purpose and usage of each module

### Testing

Testing follows RULES.md guidelines:
- Writes unit tests for all public functions
- Tests both happy path and error cases
- Uses property-based testing where appropriate
- Maintains high code coverage

### Security Practices

Security practices follow RULES.md guidelines:
- Validates all user input
- Sanitizes output data
- Implements proper authentication and authorization at higher layers
- Uses parameterized queries (handled by database layer)
- Implements proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Applies the principle of least privilege for system access
- Uses secure coding practices
