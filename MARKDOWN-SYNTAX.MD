In Markdown syntax, which is what RULES.md uses, the symbols you're asking about have specific meanings:

## `####` (Four Hash Symbols)
This represents a **fourth-level heading** in Markdown. The heading hierarchy in Markdown is:
- `#` = First level heading (main sections)
- `##` = Second level heading (subsections)
- `###` = Third level heading (sub-subsections)
- `####` = Fourth level heading (sub-sub-subsections)

In the context of your RULES.md file at lines 940-943, `#### Example 2: AMM Development` is a fourth-level heading that introduces the second example about AMM (Automated Market Maker) development.

## `**` (Double Asterisks)
These represent **bold text** in Markdown. When you surround text with double asterisks, it makes that text appear in bold formatting.

In your example:
- `**Priority 1**` renders as **Priority 1** (bold text)
- `**Priority 2**` renders as **Priority 2** (bold text)

## Full Context of Lines 940-943

```markdown
#### Example 2: AMM Development
- **Priority 1**: Core pricing mechanisms (Constant Product, StableSwap Invariant)
- **Priority 2**: Enhanced algorithms (Curve Fitting, Newton-Raphson) and fee management
```

This structure is showing:
1. A fourth-level heading introducing "Example 2: AMM Development"
2. A bullet point showing what Priority 1 involves for AMM (in bold)
3. A bullet point showing what Priority 2 involves for AMM (in bold)

This formatting makes the document easy to read and navigate, with clear hierarchical structure and emphasized key terms.
