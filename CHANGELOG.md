# DEX-OS Change Log

# [0.3.3] - 2025-11-05

### Added
- Token issuance surface that covers three flows:
  * `/auth/token/shared` validates per-trader shared secrets defined via `TRADER_SECRETS`.
  * `/auth/challenge` + `/auth/token/wallet` provide a challenge/response handshake for wallet signatures.
  * `cargo run -p dex-api --bin issue_token -- --trader-id ...` CLI helper mints short-lived JWTs directly.
- Market depth REST endpoint (`/orderbook/depth`) and live WebSocket feed (`/ws/depth`) with broadcast updates after each orderbook mutation.
- Config knobs for JWT issuer/TTL, wallet challenge TTL, and secret parsing with helpful validation errors.
- Frontend auth helpers that call the new endpoints so users can mint tokens by secret or wallet signature without leaving the UI.

### Changed
- `AuthManager` can now sign tokens (encoding key + issuance helpers) while the UI persists issued tokens automatically.
- Session panel in `dex-ui` was redesigned to surface token issuance tools alongside wallet/JWT fields.

### Security
- Wallet challenges are single-use, time-boxed, and verified with `personal_sign`/secp256k1 recovery to avoid replay.
